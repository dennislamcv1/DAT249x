Ethics and Law in Data and Analytics


# Step One: Explore the Data

To explore the data, you will want to ask and answer questions such as:

How many observations are in this table?

How many variables in this table?

Which variables appear to be from collected data?

Which variables appear to be assigned by the user?

Which variables appear to generated by algorithms?

Can any variables be safely eliminated?

What is the likely meaning of the various columns?

Is there any info available (typically from the web) that will help me with the previous questions?

# Step Two: Explore the ethical context

Without knowing all the details, what variables all likely to be ethically relevant? Why? Which of the five values do they likely relate to?

What data was not collected that might be given some ethical insights? Is there any way to work around this?

# Step Three: Explore Relationships Between the Data

Here are some questions we answer in the video. You should follow along with Excel. In the multiple choice quiz that follows, you will be asked a question that are similar to the ones below but are not the same:


Is there a significant discrepancy between the recidivism predicted of white defendants and other races?

Is there a strong relationship between prior arrests and the prediction of recidivism?
